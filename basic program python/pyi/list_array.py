# List can be used as array because a python doesn't have in built array as data 
#structure so we can easily use list as array in 1D or multi-D
# List methods...
l1=[2,3,5,1,34,22]
# List is type of data structure / type in python like strings ,turple , dictonaries, set etc
# In python there are two type of function ...
# 1. Function that return value that can be store in new variable like sort_l1=l1.sort()
# or in original variable like l1=l1.sort()
# 2. Function that actually change the actual list l1 so we just need two print(l1) without storing in new 
# or original variable.
l1.sort()
print(l1)# it's equal valid for other data type in python ...


#l1=l1.sort() print the return none as output why?
# l1=l1.sort()
# print(l1)--> we saving in original variable of list made to represent the data structure in this program ...
# but in it will return none as result of type two function ...
# same with 
# l1_sort=l1.sort()
# print(l1_sort)--> we are saving in new variable of list made to represent ...
